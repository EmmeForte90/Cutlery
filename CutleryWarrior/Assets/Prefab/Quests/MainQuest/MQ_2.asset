  Startdialogue:
  - Mh? Who are you, stranger? I don't have time to talk now.... My brave young nephew
    was trapped in the<color=red>Shining Mine</color>. His life is intrinsically
    linked to that of the entire village.
  - Mmmh... The city of <color=red>Mollica</color>? it's inaccessible at the moment,
    only I can give you a pass into the city... Mmmh, but... If you can bring my
    nephew back to me safe and sound I could give you one.
  - The mine is located southeast from here, keep this mine pass or the soldiers
    won't let you continue. Normally I wouldn't ask like this at the first person
    who comes along but I'm really desperate.
  - Good luck, stranger. If you don't come back I will prepare a grave for you...
    and for my nephew.
  Middledialogue:
  - You can find the <color=red>Shining Mine</color> to the Southeast.
  Endingdialogue:
  - You did! my nephew told me what you did. A thousand thanks. Now he wants to join
    your adventures. I don't want it, but what can I do?
  - Please take care of him, it seems strong but in the truth it's  too fragile.
  - Oh, almost forgot, take here, <color=red> the pass for the city. </color>
  - Here, and good luck in your journey!
  Afterdialogue:
  - Good luck in your journey!
