  Startdialogue:
  - Mh? Who are you, stranger? I don't have time to talk now.... My brave young nephew
    was trapped in the<color=red>Shining Mine</color>. His life is intrinsically
    linked to that of the entire village.
  - I see but i need to go to Mollica. Someone told me you can give me a permitt,
    may I ask one, please?
  - 'Mmmh... The city of <color=red>Mollica</color>?

    I can give you a pass into
    the city... Mmmh, but... if you want one  you can do something for me in return?'
  - I'm in a hurry. I don't want to be disrespectful, but I really don't have time.
  - Normally I wouldn't ask like this at the first person who comes along but I'm
    really desperate. Could you save my nephew? He went into the mines and hasn't
    come back.
  - Sigh... Okay, fine. I'll TRY to save your nephew, but I expect the permit for
    Mollica when I get back.
  - Absolutely, I always keep my promises! Now, take this, it's the permit for the
    mines. Without it, the guards won't let you in.
  - Ok, thank you.
  - Good luck, stranger. If you don't come back I will prepare a grave for you...
    and for my nephew.
  Middledialogue:
  - You can find the <color=red>Shining Mine</color> to the Southeast.
  Endingdialogue:
  - You did! my nephew told me what you did. A thousand thanks. Now he wants to join
    your adventures. I don't want it, but what can I do?
  - Please take care of him, it seems strong but in the truth it's  too fragile.
  - Oh, almost forgot, take here, <color=red> the pass for the city. </color>
  - Here, and good luck in your journey!
  Afterdialogue:
  - Good luck in your journey!
