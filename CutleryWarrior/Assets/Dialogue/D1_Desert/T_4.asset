  dialogue:
  - Oh? Finally a sign of civilization!
  - Uh... Hello? Are you a soldier? Where are we?
  - Hm? And who are you? It's forbidden to enter Mollica until further notice.
  - Mollica? It seems like the city I'm looking for. Do you happen to know Abbot
    Moccup? I urgently need to speak with him.
  - You are looking for Moccup? He is the abbot of the Mollica temple... But as I
    said, no one enters <color=red>Mollica without a permit.</color>
  - Can't you make an exception?
  - Absolutely not! Without a permit, no one gets through. But you can ask for one
    from Don Ferrante. He is the head of the village of Briciola, a small village
    at west from here.
  - What a hassle...
  - Remember,<color=red> Briciola is to the west from here.</color> Good luck!
