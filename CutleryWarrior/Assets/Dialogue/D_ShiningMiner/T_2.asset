  - That's... Alden!
  - Varren... What are you doing here?
  - What do you think? I came to find you. It's been a long time since we've seen
    you around. We were all worried!
  - I understand... And who are you?
  - I'm Elara. Don Ferrante sent me to find you. Frankly, I didn't think we'd find
    you alive given the mess we encountered.
  - <shake>Hey!</shake> We don't say those things! Fortunately, we got here in time!
  - You're right, I'd say at this point, we can go.
  - I'm not going back
  - Excuse me?
  - You said it yourself, it's a mess in here. The miners dug too deep and awakened
    an ancient evil that will spawn more monsters if I don't stop it. I'm not leaving
    until I've eradicated it.
  - That's why you came down here alone? Impressive, Alden. Truly impressive. But
    you could have let me know; I would have definitely helped.
  - The thing is, it's a personal matter, and I didn't want to involve anyone in
    my issues.
  - All right, I understand that you're determined to stay and save the mine, right?
    Well, then all that's left is to help you in your quest.
  - Are you sure? It could be very dangerous.
  - <shake>Oh, come on, Alden, you know me well!</shake> I laugh in the face of danger,
    and Elara here knows her way around with her magic. I assure you we won't be
    a hindrance!
  - That's not what I meant... But if you're both so determined, then okay.
  - So it's settled. Let's go and take down whatever is in there.
