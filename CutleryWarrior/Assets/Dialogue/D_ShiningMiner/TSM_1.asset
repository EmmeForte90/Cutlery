  dialogue:
  - Uff... everything okay?
  - Yes, yes... Umpf, no one asked for your help; I would have managed to annihilate
    them anyway. I'm a knife knight, you know. But who are you? I've never seen you
    before. You're not from Mollica, are you?
  - Oh, not exactly, but truth be told, that's exactly where I should be going. I'm
    here because Don Ferrante promised me a permit as long as I found his nephew.
    Are you Alden by any chance?
  - No, actually, I'm looking for him too. Alden and I are old friends, and I haven't
    seen him around for a while. When Don Ferrante told me he had gone to the mine,
    I came here to look for him.
  - Hey, now that I think about it, we have the same goal, finding Alden! You're
    skilled in magic. What do you say we team up for this mission? You don't even
    know what Alden looks like, but I, being familiar with him, won't have any trouble
    recognizing him. Are you in?
  - Well, why not? I suppose it'll be easier to wrap up this story if we work together.
    Lead the way.
  - Perfect! By the way, my name is Varren, don't forget it! And you are...?
  - My name is Elara, I am a wandering fork.
  - Oh, how strange, I feel like I've heard that name before... Well, let's go then,
    Elara! Alden, here we come!
