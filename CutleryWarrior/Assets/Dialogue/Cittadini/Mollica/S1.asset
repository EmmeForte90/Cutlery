  - 'I''ve heard that you intend to face the Trial of the Furnace. I appreciate your
    determination. However, the desert is a inhospitable territory, where many dangers
    and challenges lurk. '
  - 'Sandstorms, wild creatures, and extreme temperatures are just some of the difficulties
    you would encounter. '
  - I only ask that you carefully consider before embarking on this endeavor. If
    there's even a slight chance to avoid the desert, I urge you to do so.
