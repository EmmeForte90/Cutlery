  dialogue:
  - 'What do you want? Just let me be, can''t you see I''m busy drowning my sorrows
    in this drink? '
  - Frustrating, really... I've been tracking the Multi-Spike for days, but I can't
    seem to bring it down. Curse that beast.
  - It roams the desert at night. I'd advise you to steer clear during those dark
    hours; it's a highly dangerous creature.
  - But why am I even telling you this? You don't strike me as the type to venture
    out at night, do you?
