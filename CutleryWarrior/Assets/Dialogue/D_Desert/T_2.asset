  dialogue:
  - This statue... Why is it here? This place is... very weird.
  - But looking at this statue, I remember something... A name. <color=red>Moccup,
    the abbot.</color> I have no idea who he is, but I'm certain he's an abbot. Perhaps
    he can help me?
  - One step at a time. Perhaps it's time to leave this strange place before thinking
    about anything else. The exit shouldn't be too far; it's best to follow the path.
